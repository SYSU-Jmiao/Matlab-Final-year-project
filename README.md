This is a final year project on Bit error rate using NOMA..

The 5G communication network has taken a giant leap in the field of mobile 
communications. Today’s wireless networks allocate users based on orthogonal multiple 
access (OMA) principle. However, as the number of users increases OMA based
approaches may not meet the spectral efficiency, low latency, and massive connectivity.
This solution can be achieved by a multiple access method called’ Non-orthogonal
multiple access. The NOMA principle emerges as a solution to improve the spectral
efficiency in next-generation wireless communication. The exact bit error rate (BER) of a
two-user and a three-user non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) system can be
calculated using NOMA. The BER obtained are compared with various modulation
techniques’ to understand which technique is better designed for a 5G system.
